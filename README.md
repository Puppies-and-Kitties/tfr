> Imagine you've just got a new job and are primed to move to a new city. You're feeling crazy excited, nervous, curious, and all the other emotions that accompany moments of big change.

With RooMe, you can toss all those cares away. Just sign-up, start swiping, and you'll have a new roommate before you finish breakfast.<br><br>
RooMe, it's Tinder for Roomies!
